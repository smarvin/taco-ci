The Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline can test TACO files across many environments, including multiple operating systems, databases, driver versions, and Tableau versions. It allows you to debug on machines where errors happen and provides messages to identify and help debug specific issues.

## Benefits of the CI pipeline

The Connectivity CI pipeline lets you:

* Use distributed test suites across machines
* Run each test suite in a clean environment
* Test a broad matrix of operating systems, databases, drivers, Tableau versions, and TACO files
* Run and get results from the Tableau Data Source Verification Tool (TDVT) test suite, usually within 10 minutes
* Bubble up actionable log messages
* Save the machine state when there’s a failure to help with diagnostics
* Test partner-built connectors on demand
* Analyze test results in Tableau. This allows you to prioritize how to fix failing tests, identify longest running test suite, detect test cases failing across all operating systems, and compare runs across various driver versions
* Isolate partner test results in a separate database

## Your repository

This GitHub repository (repo) is for your CI pipeline. The repo is for your resources (TACO files, related drivers, install script for the driver, TDS files that contain credentials to access your database, etc.).

This repository has [triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) for [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions) that we set up in advance. These triggers run CI validation flows for your drivers and TACO connectors.

The repo also contains the configuration file for your CI TACO pipeline. This file, `ci.json`, points to your connector artifacts, drivers, and TDVT running setup. The `ci.json` file configures a group of resources that GitHub action workflow will pick up for running a CI validation workflow.

The [GitHub action workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) uses your `ci.json` file to run validation workflow. The following is a sample configuration file.

```json
    {
    "connector": {
      "connector-file-path": "taco/memsql-packaged/connector/MEMSQLTACOPACKAGED.taco"

      ]
    },
    "docker-db": {
      "skip": true,

    },

    ]
  }
```

## How the CI pipeline works

To configure a specific run, use your configuration file (`ci.json`). If you want to test various configuration versions, you can create several configuration files to define each unique set of options.

When you are ready to run a test using the CI Pipeline, you add a release tag to your repository to trigger a GitHub action. GitHub action copies your resources into an Amazon S3 bucket for use by the CI pipeline.

The workflow consists of the following actions:
1. Set up job
2. Workflow setup
3. Validate CI configuration
4. Upload artifacts to Amazon S3
5. Show reference information
6. Post-workflow setup
7. Complete job

Now that you know more about the CI Pipeline, you can [configure your GitHub repository](ci_configuration.html) to automate your connector testing.
