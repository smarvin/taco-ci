The CI Pipeline emails you a CSV file. This file contains detailed results for the test cases defined in your connector's configuration file. We provide a Tableau Workbook that gives you a high-level overview of how many tests passed in each category, as well as the tools to drill down to individual test cases. This allows you to see the expected values versus actual values, the generated SQL statement, and any errors Tableau or your product reported while running or attempting the test.

For a test that failed, the *Error msg* column provides information on the failure. The generated log files included in your email can provide more details, including looking through logs on your productâ€™s side.
